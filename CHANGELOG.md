## 1.7.0
* Added: Support for interactive (stdin) console applications in the output panel
* Fixed: Did not display feedback if trying to use breakpoints with an executable without debug symbols
* #### 1.7.1
	* Fixed: `path` parameter was wrongfully required, and would break in weird ways if it missing (for instance with remote debugging)
	* Fixed: Breakpoints would not work if custom commands were used to select a target (custom commands are now executed first, instead)
	* Improved: Error feedback with regard to missing executables and debug info

## 1.6.0
* Added: `gdb_executable`, `gdb_arguments` and `gdb_commands` parameters

* #### 1.6.1
	* Fixed: Would break if the debugger engaged on threads other than thread 1
* #### 1.6.2
	* Fixed: When executing custom startup commands, would not process the result before starting the next (delayed responses could execute when now in the wrong state)
	* Fixed: Did not work on targets that do not support "run", such as remote targets

* #### 1.2.1
	* Fixed: Stacktrace displayed the line number twice
