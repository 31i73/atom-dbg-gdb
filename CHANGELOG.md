* Added: Support for interactive (stdin) console applications in the output panel
* Fixed: Did not display feedback if trying to use breakpoints with an executable without debug symbols
* #### 1.7.1
	* Fixed: `path` parameter was wrongfully required, and would break in weird ways if it missing (for instance with remote debugging)
	* Fixed: Breakpoints would not work if custom commands were used to select a target (custom commands are now executed first, instead)
	* Improved: Error feedback with regard to missing executables and debug info
* #### 1.7.2
	* Fixed: Did not show the output panel in old (pre 1.17) versions of atom
* #### 1.7.3

* #### 1.7.5
	* Fixed: Error starting a debug in linux
	* Fixed: Would error if attempting to debug in \*nix without the output panel
* #### 1.7.7
	* Added: Breakpoints now work with dynamically loaded libraries ([CedScilab](https://github.com/CedScilab))
* #### 1.7.8
	* Improved: Better reporting when executable debug symbols are not available or breakpoints are in invalid files ([#35 - wevcode](https://github.com/31i73/atom-dbg/issues/35))

## 1.6.0
* Added: `gdb_executable`, `gdb_arguments` and `gdb_commands` parameters
* Fixed: Debugging would fail if the `cwd` wasn't included (this should be optional)
* #### 1.6.1
	* Fixed: Would break if the debugger engaged on threads other than thread 1
* #### 1.6.2

* Fixed: Errors would be throw for identifiers containing special characters
* Added: Config option for logging GDB communication to console for bug reporting
